# Market Price Prediction

This project aims to predict market prices using various machine learning techniques. Developed by Yosief Dagnachew, this project leverages multiple Python packages within the Anaconda framework to preprocess data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Introduction

This project aims to help businesses and consumers understand and predict price trends in the market. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to provide accurate price predictions based on historical data and various features.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model building and training
- Model evaluation and validation
- Price prediction

 Installation

To run this project, you need to have Anaconda installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yosiefdagnachew//Python-final-project.git
   cd /Python-final-project
   ```
2. Create a new conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create --name market_price_prediction python=3.8
   conda activate market_price_prediction
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   conda install --file requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, you can install packages individually:

   ```bash
   conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

 Usage

1. Prepare the data:

   Ensure your dataset is in the `data/` directory. The dataset should be in CSV format with the necessary features for prediction.

2. Run the preprocessing script
3. Train the model
4. Evaluate the model
5. Make predictions

 Models

The project utilizes various machine learning models, including but not limited to:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Results

The results of the model training and evaluation will be saved in the `results/` directory. Visualizations and performance metrics will be available for comparison and analysis.
